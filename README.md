# WIKI

This is the second project I built during CS50 Web, it basically was my first introduction into Django, templating 
and using databases in combination to web applications.

## Specifications 
* Entry page shows a list of all the entries in the encyclopedia database, with links to each entry.
* Search bar that allows user to type a query and redirects them to their search.
* Allows user to create new entries into the encyclopedia database accepting markdown sintax for the formatting. 
* On each entry page the user has a button called edit page where they are redirected to a form where they can edit the information as they like (the original content is shown in markdown syntax).
* Random page button: redirects the user to a random page of the wiki.
